I'm a big fan of vundle. There's a quick start available on 
the github page but here are some basic steps for windows.

Step 1: Find your home directory

Vim stores it's configuration files in a "home" directory.
On windows this location will vary but one of the easiest 
ways to locate your home directory is to open vim and type 
:echo $HOME. 

Vim will print the home directory which is where our 
configuration files need to live.

Step 2: Set up vimfiles and _vimrc

There are two major components to configuring vim. 

The first is a 

_vimrc 

file which is a plain text file that contains configuration 
settings. 

The second is a 

vimfilesfolder 

which contains plugins and other useful vim things. Both of 
these files belong in your HOME directory which we located 
in the previous step. Sometimes in tutorials you will see 
references to 

.vim 
and 
.vimrc

these are the 

Linux/Unix/MacOSX
equivalents to

vimfiles

and 
_vimrc. 

These files will also work on windows but are more difficult 
to create as windows explorer won't let you create files or 
folders that begin with a dot.

To create a 

_vimrc 
simply create a file named 
_vimrc using 

Right Rlick>New>Text Document. 

Make sure your 
_vimrc file 
doesn't have the 
.txt extension.

You can double check this in explorer by looking at the 
Type column. 
If the type is File then you're good to go. If the type is 
Text Document or anything else then you need to show 
file extensions and get rid of the extension.

In the same place as your 
_vimrc 
create a folder named 
vimfiles.

Step 3: Get git
Git is a source control system and it also allows vundle to 
automatically manage your plugins for you. You can download 
it here. Make sure to pick 

"Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt".

Step 4: Install Vundle

Open PowerShell or command prompt and type:
====== one line below =======
git clone 
https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git 
$HOME\vimfiles\bundle\vundle$HOME\v
======                ========

Make sure to replace 
$HOME 
with the path we discovered in step 1.

Step 5: Set up your _vimrc

Now we need to write your _vimrc and decide what plugins 
you want. 
Here's an example _vimrc that installs nerdtree for you:

set nocompatible               " turns off legacy vi mode
filetype off                   " required!

set rtp+=~/vimfiles/bundle/vundle/
call vundle#rc()

Bundle 'gmarik/vundle' 

" Use the bundle command to select plugins
Bundle 'scrooloose/nerdtree'

" Bundle automatically searches github for you.

filetype plugin indent on     

" required!

Step 6: Let vundle get to work!

Now we're ready to let vundle do it's job. Open vim and 
type :BundleInstall vundle will download and install the 
plugins you specified in your _vimrc.
